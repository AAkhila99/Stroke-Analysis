## Stroke Prediction**

This project focuses on predicting the risk of stroke in individuals based on various health parameters using Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

## Introduction

Stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality globally. Early identification of individuals prone to stroke is crucial for proactively implementing preventive measures and alleviating the impact of this condition. Machine learning offers a promising approach for stroke risk prediction based on health metrics and demographic information.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify individuals as either at risk or not at risk of stroke based on features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, etc.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project comprises anonymized health records of individuals, including smoking habits and other health indicators relevant to stroke risk. It has been sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset. The data has been preprocessed to handle missing values, data transformation, normalize features, and ensure data integrity.

## Algorithm Used

**Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In this project, a Linear SVM model is employed to build a predictive model for stroke risk classification. LinearSVC is like Support Vector Classifier with linear kernel but with more flexibility in the choice of penalties. Given that the dataset is imbalanced, LinearSVC was selected to better accommodate such disparities.

## Implementation

The project implementation involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, data transformation, and feature normalization.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the distribution of features, identifying correlations, and extracting insights from the dataset.
3. Model Training: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training a Linear SVM model on the training data.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using relevant evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Model Interpretation: Analyzing the importance of features and understanding the decision boundaries of the SVM classifier.

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
3. Execute the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the Linear SVM model, and evaluate its performance.

## Conclusion

By leveraging the Linear Support Vector Machine algorithm, this project aims to contribute to early identification of individuals at risk of stroke. The predictive model developed can assist healthcare practitioners in implementing preventive strategies and interventions tailored to high-risk individuals, thereby potentially reducing the incidence and impact of stroke.
